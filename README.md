TASKS 1
Python-based AI voice assistant that performs various tasks, including web searches, playing music, telling jokes, sending emails, retrieving Wikipedia summaries, and controlling system functions like locking, shutting down, or restarting the computer. The assistant uses speech recognition to take voice commands, text-to-speech (TTS) for responses, and integrates APIs such as Wolfram Alpha, Wikipedia, Twilio, and SMTP for enhanced functionality. This project showcases my skills in Python, automation, natural language processing (NLP), and API integration.
